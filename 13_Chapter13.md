# Chapter 13: Modern Piracy and its Impact

The final chapter of our journey through the epic tales of piracy brings us to the present day. Though piracy on the high seas may seem like a relic of the past, the reality is quite the opposite. In fact, modern piracy continues to pose a serious threat to international shipping and the safety of sailors worldwide.

Piracy is defined as the act of robbery and/or criminal violence committed by parties aboard a ship at sea. Modern piracy poses a threat to global trade and maritime security, with roughly 195 actual or attempted pirate attacks having occurred in 2020 alone, according to the International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Centre (IMB PRC).

To help us navigate this complex and ongoing issue, we're thrilled to have a special guest join us. Captain Richard Phillips, whose real-life encounter with modern-day pirates was famously portrayed in the movie "Captain Phillips," will offer his insights and experiences throughout this chapter.

Captain Phillips will share his thoughts on the current state of piracy, including the reasons behind its resurgence, and the measures being taken to try and combat it. In addition, we will explore the harsh realities that pirates face themselves.

We will also discuss the cultural and societal impacts modern piracy has on coastal communities, both in terms of economics and safety, and examine the ways in which civil and military forces are working to address these issues. As always, we will end with a discussion of the pirate's code, and how it pertains to modern piracy.

It must be noted that the act of piracy, at any point in history, is a crime that ultimately affects far more than just the pirates and sailors themselves. It has serious repercussions on global politics, trade and commerce, and innocent people who fall victim to it. It is our hope that reading about modern piracy will help raise awareness about an ongoing issue that deserves our attention.

Join us as we conclude this epic journey with a look at piracy in the present day, and Captain Richard Phillips' unique and insightful perspective on the subject.
# Chapter 13: Modern Piracy and its Impact

As the briny blue sea swelled with waves in the present day, a new kind of piracy had taken root. Instead of wooden ships and cutlasses, modern pirates wielded high-tech equipment and automatic weapons. These brigands terrorized international shipping lanes, their actions disrupting trade and causing economic chaos.

On this voyage, we're joined by a special guest, the famed Captain Richard Phillips, who had a personal encounter with modern-day pirates that was immortalized in film. With his firsthand experience, Captain Phillips would provide us with insight into modern piracy and its consequences.

Our journey through the subject led us into the heart of the pirate lairs located in Somalia, and we found those who call this place their home, had turned to piracy to alleviate their economic difficulties. Although not forgiving their actions, we could empathize with their situation.

Despite their struggles, we made it clear that piracy is a crime and that there are no excuses for these lawless actions on the seas. We discussed the impact of modern piracy on global trade, examining cases where entire shipping lines have been shut down, and innocent sailors have been harmed or killed.

Captain Phillips also talked about the measures being taken to fight back against modern pirates, including the use of private security forces and international naval patrols.

As we delved further into the societal impact, we learned that piracy has unfortunate effects on the local communities. The presence of pirates has a concomitant association with the existence of failed states and underprivileged communities, where piracy could appear to be the only solution to survival.

We also took a walk around the pirate's code, and how despite the evolution of piracy, there are still universally recognized traditions and customs associated with the pirate way of life that have continued to this day.

Our voyage through modern piracy widened our understanding of this dire situation for the new age, prompting us to navigate towards the necessity of international collaboration to curb these actions. 

And so, as our saga came to a close, we understood that our voyage was yet to end. Just as piracy has taken on new forms, the efforts to combat it must adapt and evolve as well.
# Resolving the Code

Throughout our journey into the world of piracy, we explored the concept of the pirate's code, which served as a set of guidelines and rules that pirates of old used to govern themselves.

For modern piracy, the pirate's code has evolved, but it is still relevant in maintaining order and integrity amongst pirates. The code also serves as a reminder that despite the piracy situation's evolution, there is still a need for accountability and collaboration, even among pirates.

One notable example of this is the suggestion made by Captain Richard Phillips, wherein he emphasized the importance of the shipping industry working hand in hand with international naval forces to combat piracy. Though they may seem like rivals, pirates and sailors alike benefit from a more secure sea. The code of cooperation to keep the sea safe is inviolable.

As with any code, though, there are areas subject to interpretation. While it is clear that piracy is wrong, the conditions that lead to piracy sometimes paint a different picture. Some pirates may turn to piracy as a means of survival, and their individual circumstances must be taken into account. But, unfortunately, modern piracy has evolved into a more organized criminal business, and it demands strict enforcement of maritime law.

We continue to navigate the present-day seas, with the code of piracy ever-present, even in the modern era. Though the specific rules may vary, the principles of accountability, cooperation, and respect remain. In keeping with the pirate tradition, it is up to modern pirates to honor the code and not only ensure their own survival but also that of a more secure maritime environment.

Thus, the code of the modern pirate continues to evolve in keeping with the times, but its core principles remain a guiding light, emphasizing the need for communication, cooperation, and shared responsibility. Like its ancient precedent, the pirate's code is here to stay, ensuring the safety of those who brave the waves and sail into the unknown.
