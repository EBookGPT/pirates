# Chapter 9: Famous Pirate Raids

In the previous chapter, we explored the infamous legacy of Edward Teach, or as he was better known, Blackbeard. We learned about his fearsome reputation and his cunning tactics which struck fear into the hearts of many. However, Blackbeard was not the only pirate to raid the high seas and make a name for himself.

In this chapter, we will delve into the history of other infamous pirate raids throughout the years. Alongside our special guest, Blackbeard, we will explore the exploits of some of the most notorious pirates of all time. From Bartholomew Roberts to Anne Bonny and Mary Read, we will uncover their daring adventures and discover what made them such legendary figures.

But, let us not forget the code that all pirates must follow. It is important to remember that while they were outlaws, they still had a code of conduct that they abided by. These rules were known as the Pirate Code and they were essential to the survival of all pirates. 

For instance, one of the most important tenets of the Pirate Code was the distribution of loot. According to the code, all wealth acquired during a raid was to be divided equally amongst the crew. No one person was to receive a larger share than another, regardless of their rank or position on the ship.

Here is some code to illustrate this principle:

```
function divideLoot(totalLoot, numberOfPirates) {
   return totalLoot / numberOfPirates;
}
```

This function would ensure that all pirates received an equal share of the loot, promoting a sense of fairness and mutual respect among the crew.

So, as we embark on this exciting journey into the world of pirate raids, let us not forget the code that they lived by. Through their daring exploits and unwavering courage, these infamous pirates have left a lasting legacy that will be remembered for centuries to come.
# Chapter 9: Famous Pirate Raids

As we set sail on the high seas, we come across a legendary pirate known to all. His name strikes fear into the hearts of many, and his reputation precedes him. This fearsome pirate is none other than Blackbeard, who has agreed to join us on our journey as we recount the most famous pirate raids of all time.

With his long black beard flowing in the wind, Blackbeard regales us with tales of Bartholomew Roberts and his daring exploits across the seas. Roberts was feared by many, and his reputation as the most successful pirate of all time was well-deserved. His raids were swift and merciless, and he made off with a fortune in stolen treasure.

But Blackbeard knows that success on the high seas is not just about the boldness of the attack. It is also about the discipline and tactics that make it possible. That is why he reminds us of the Pirate Code, the set of rules that guides all pirates in their journeys.

"Remember the Code," Blackbeard says, "It is what makes us successful in our raids."

And so, we heed his words and refer to the Pirate Code as we recount the exploits of Anne Bonny and Mary Read, two of the most famous female pirates in history. These fierce women dressed as men to blend in with their crewmates, and their fearless courage gained them a place in the annals of pirate history.

But again, it is the code that made their success possible. The Pirate Code mandated that all pirates were equal and had an equal say in the running of the ship. No one was above the other, and all shared equally in the spoils of the raid.

Here is a code sample that demonstrates this principle:

```
function distributeLoot(crew, loot) {
   const shares = loot / crew.length;
   for (let i = 0; i < crew.length; i++) {
      crew[i].gold += shares;
   }
}
```

With the proper distribution of loot, all pirates on board felt an equal stake in the outcome of the raid, and there was less chance of infighting or mutiny.

As we sail on into the night, Blackbeard reminds us that the Pirate Code is not only a set of rules but a way of life. It governs all aspects of a pirate's journey, including their raids and their relationships with their crewmates. With this code as our guide, we continue to explore the legendary pirate raids of the world, in search of adventure, treasure, and the eternal legacy of the sea.
In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of the Pirate Code, which served as the guiding force behind the actions of all pirates. In the current chapter, we continue to explore the code by showcasing a code sample that demonstrates one of its fundamental tenets - the fair distribution of loot.

The code sample provided is a JavaScript function called `distributeLoot()` that takes two parameters - an array of crew members and the total amount of loot acquired during a raid. The function calculates the share of each pirate by dividing the total loot by the total number of crew members.

```
function distributeLoot(crew, loot) {
   const shares = loot / crew.length;
```

The code then iterates through the array of crew members using a loop and adds the calculated share to each pirate's gold. 

```
   for (let i = 0; i < crew.length; i++) {
      crew[i].gold += shares;
   }
}
```

This ensures that all pirates, regardless of rank or position, receive an equal share of the loot. This promotes a sense of fairness and mutual respect among the crew, and reduces the chance of conflict or mutiny.

The function is just one small example of how the Pirate Code was enforced among the crew, and how it played a crucial role in the success of pirate raids. It ensured that pirates had a common set of rules to follow, which helped them work together towards a common goal.

By incorporating code into the chapter, readers can not only learn about the theoretical concept of the Pirate Code, but also see how it worked in practice. This makes the learning experience more engaging and interactive, and helps readers better understand the role that code played in shaping the pirate culture.
