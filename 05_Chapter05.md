# Chapter 5: Pirate's Code of Conduct

The Pirate's way of life is often romanticized in popular culture, however, in reality, it was far from the glitz and glamour depicted on the silver screen. Piracy was a demanding and often dangerous lifestyle that required adherence to a strict set of rules and regulations. These rules were known as the "Pirate's Code of Conduct."

The Pirate's Code of Conduct was upheld by all members of the crew, from the lowliest deckhand to the infamous pirate captain. It dictated the way they interacted with each other, the way they treated prisoners, and even how they divided their loot. Adherence to the code was necessary to maintain discipline and order amongst the pirates, and any pirate who violated the code was subject to severe consequences.

In this chapter, we will delve deep into the Pirate's Code of Conduct, exploring its origins and the specific rules that pirates lived by. We will learn how the code was enforced, and the punishments doled out to anyone who dared to defy it. Along the way, we'll discover some fascinating facts about the pirate's life and learn how their unique code of conduct contributed to the legend of the pirate. 

But first, let's recap what we learned about Pirate Ships and Weapons in the last chapter.
# The Pirate's Code: A Greek Mythology Epic

In ancient Greece, there existed a band of sailors known as the Pirates of the Aegean. They were a fierce group, feared by merchants and sailors alike for their ruthless plundering of merchant ships. The Pirates of the Aegean lived by a strict code of conduct that they had developed over years of life on the high seas. If someone wished to become a pirate, they had to swear an oath to this code, and the punishment for breaking it was severe.

The first rule of the Pirate's Code was that all booty taken from a ship was to be divided equally among the crew. If someone was caught hoarding riches, the punishment was to be marooned on a deserted island, with nothing but the clothes on their back.

The second rule of the Pirate's Code was that crewmembers could not gamble away their share of the loot. If someone was caught cheating or gambling on board, they were to be keelhauled, dragged under the ship's bottom through the barnacles, and left to drown in the wake.

The third rule of the Pirate's Code was that all disputes were to be settled on land, with swords or pistols. Disputes were never to be settled on board the ship, as it could cause a mutiny or plung the ship into chaos.

The fourth rule of the Pirate's Code was that crewmembers were not allowed to engage in fraternization with the prisoners. If someone was caught breaking this rule, they were to be whipped and then put back in the brig alongside the prisoners - as punishment.

The fifth rule of the Pirate's Code was that no crewmember was allowed to run away from battle. If someone was caught fleeing, they were to be marooned or left to die on the battlefield.

These were the core principles of the Pirate's Code, and they were passed down from generation to generation of pirates. Though life at sea was harsh, pirates lived by their code, following it with unwavering determination. In doing so, they managed to maintain a sense of order amidst the harshness of life on the high seas.

Today, we can still learn from the Pirate's Code of Conduct, applicable in the modern day. For example, we can use these codes to design ethical algorithms, such as those described in “The Pirate Code of Conduct: A Deontological Fallacy or a Necessary Evil?” authored by Dr. A. Smartypants.

# Resolving the Pirate's Code

While the Pirate's Code of Conduct was strict, it was also fair and ensured that the crewmembers were all treated equally. If a crewmember was caught breaking the rules, they were punished accordingly, without exception.

As the years passed, the Pirate's Code became less prevalent, and pirates became less organized. However, the principles of the code still exist across many cultures today. In modern times, we can use the Pirate's Code to create and live by our own ethical codes that ensure fairness and justice in our business dealings, maritime affairs, or even our personal affairs.

In the end, while piracy may seem like a lawless pursuit, the Pirate's Code ensured that pirates maintained a sense of order, discipline, and respect for their fellowmen. The Pirate's Code of Conduct may be long forgotten, but its legacy lives on in the lessons it teaches. A code that seeks to treat all crewmembers fairly, distribute booty equally, and promote order is essential for everyone to maintain justice and balance in today’s society.
